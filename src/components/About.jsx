                My earliest memory of programming was trying to batch script my very own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game on Windows 7. 
                When I took a class in high school, I discovered what computer science actually was and understood my passion for it. 
                <br/><br/>
                My time at college has taught me about necessary topics like object-oriented paradigms and algorithmic design. Away from pesky assignments however, 
                I discovered the versatility of web development and brought my own ideas to life. Since then, I've learned several technologies spanning 
                frontend to backend, and want to continue to construct full-stack solutions in the future!
