                Im currently a senior studying computer science at California State University, Pomona. My programming journey began with Java, 
                with my curriculum primarily focused on object-oriented languages and design of algorithms. 
                However, my interest in the versatility of the web led me to explore it further.
                Since then, I've enjoyed delving into technologies spanning from frontend to backend and constructing full-stack solutions that stand on their own.
