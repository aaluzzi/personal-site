                I'm currently a senior studying computer science at California State University, Pomona. My programming journey began with Java, 
                with my curriculum primarily focused on object-oriented languages and design of algorithms. 
                However, discovering the versatility of the web made me explore it myself.
                Since then, I've enjoyed delving into technologies spanning from frontend to backend and constructing full-stack solutions that stand on their own.
