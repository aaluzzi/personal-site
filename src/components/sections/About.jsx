                I'm an upcoming computer science graduate from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona 
                eager to apply my problem-solving abilities to contribute to real world solutions. My curriculum has equipped me with
                heavy experience in object-oriented programming, 
                further enhanced by topics such as data structures and algorithm design. 
                On the side, I discovered a passion for web development and dove into 
                technologies spanning frontend to backend in order to bring my application ideas to life. 
                <br/><br/>
                Through my projects I've found that whatever the requirements, 
                I'm always open to learning new skills to ensure proficiency.
                Let's collaborate and build something impactful!
