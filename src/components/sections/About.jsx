                My earliest memory of programming was trying to batch script a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game as a teen. 
                It wasn't until a high school class that I understood what computer science was and my passion for it. 
                <br/><br/>
                College has taught me formal topics like object-oriented paradigms and algorithmic design. On the side however, 
                I discovered the versatility of web development and brought my own ideas to life. I've learned many technologies spanning 
                frontend to backend, and aspire to build more polished full-stack solutions in the future.
                Away from programming, my interests include fitness, billiards, and piano.
