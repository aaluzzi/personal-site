                I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, eager to apply my problem-solving skills to real-world challenges.
                My coursework has given me a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and system design.
                On the side, my discovery of web development has driven me to explore both frontend and backend technologies to bring my own ideas to life.
                <br /><br />
                Through my projects, I’ve shown adaptability and a willingness to learn new technologies to meet various requirements.
                I’m excited to collaborate and build impactful solutions together!
