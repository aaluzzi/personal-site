                I'm a recently graduated software developer that loves to apply my problem-solving skills to real-world challenges.
                My background includes a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and system design. 
                <br /><br />
                In my spare time, Iâ€™ve delved into web development, exploring both frontend and backend technologies to bring my own ideas to life. Building personal projects has taught me adaptability and a need to learn new technologies to meet requirements.
                <br /><br />
                I enjoy working with others and am always excited about the possibility of creating something impactful together. Let's connect!
